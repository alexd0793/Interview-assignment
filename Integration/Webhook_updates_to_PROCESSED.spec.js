/*
Didn't work until now with WebSocket mock or Webhooks, i knew about them, so i used AI to help me with approach, 
and theoretical understainding.I am using AI when necessary to speed up learning and implementation.
So this is how i was thinking about it:

This test verifies the integration between the frontend and the backendâ€™s real-time event channel.
When the backend receives a webhook from a payment processor, it emits a WebSocket message to the UI.
In my test, I mock that WebSocket event directly in the browser context, dispatching a simulated message of type TRANSACTION_UPDATED.
The test then asserts that the transaction status in the UI automatically changes from PENDING to PROCESSED without any manual refresh.
